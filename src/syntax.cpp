#include <iostream> 
//header libary allows to work with input and output objects such as cout

using namespace std;
// means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library

//blank spaces are ignored and make code more readable

int main () {
    cout << "Hello World"; 
    return 0;
}

//int main is the function and all code inside is executed
//every statement ends with a semicolon ;
// return 0 ends the function
//Don't forget to add semicolon at the end of the statement

//if you chose to omit the namespace use std:: instead of cout followed by :: operator for some objects
//example  std::cout<<"Hello World";
