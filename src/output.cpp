// The cout object, together with the << operator, is used to output values/print text:
// You can add as many cout objects as you want. However, note that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:
// \n adds new line , two \n add a blank line 
// \n The newline character (\n) is called an escape sequence, and it forces the cursor 
// to change its position to the beginning of the next line on the screen.This results in a new line.
// \t creates a horizontal tab
// \\ Inserts a backslash character (\)
// \"  Inserts a double quote character

// this is a single comment
// Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
